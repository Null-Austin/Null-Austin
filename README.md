Hello, I'm Austin. I work In python, html, css, javascript and lua. clearly python is my favorite. I support any negative comments, along as you have proof of it, being a bad scripted is not proof ;). I enjoy talking, and I'm american, console wars suck, because atari is clearly the best console. Markdown is annoying

I am a chest enthusiast, and I'm sadly only 400 rating, I have been playing on and off for roughly half a year.
<br><br>
I try to be as active as humanly possible, but that's kinda hard for me, lol. I'm not very serious all the time.
<br><br>
I'm a Christian, who believes in, selflessness (the opposite of selfishness). I am kind, I been told. and I support Ukraine ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦. I do not support either Palestinian nor Israel. I love all, even my haters. and I try to correct myself. but may fail, please tell me, just don't be rude about it.
<br><br>
I play pc, xbox one, xbox 360, and countless other systems on emulators. some of my favorite games are wolfenstein 3d, frogger, and minecraft. I do play some rainbow six siege. I enjoy the news, and I'm very unorganized. please come and visit some more!
